The program implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in a binary matrix. The matrix consists of cells that can either be traversable (1) or blocked (0). The BFS algorithm explores all possible paths from a starting point to a destination point, ensuring that the shortest path is found.

Key Components
Matrix Definition:

The matrix is defined as a 2D array of size ROW x COL, where each cell can either be 1 (traversable) or 0 (blocked).
Direction Arrays:

Two arrays, dRow and dCol, are defined to represent the four possible movement directions (up, down, left, right). These arrays help in calculating the new positions during traversal.
Validation Function:

The isValid function checks if a cell is within the bounds of the matrix, is traversable (1), and has not been visited yet. This ensures that the BFS only explores valid cells.
BFS Logic:

The BFS is implemented in the shortestPath function:
Initialization:
A visited array is created to keep track of which cells have been visited.
A queue is initialized to store the cells to be explored, along with their distances from the source.
The starting cell is marked as visited and added to the queue.
Exploration Loop:
While there are cells in the queue, the algorithm dequeues the front cell and checks if it is the destination.
If it is the destination, the distance is returned.
If not, the algorithm explores all four possible directions from the current cell.
For each valid neighboring cell, it is marked as visited, and its coordinates along with the updated distance are enqueued.
If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, the function returns -1, indicating that no path exists.
Main Function:

The main function initializes the matrix and calls the shortestPath function with the starting and destination coordinates.
It prints the result, indicating either the length of the shortest path or that no path exists.
Example
For the given matrix, if the starting point is (0, 0) and the destination is (3, 4), the BFS will explore all possible paths from the starting point, checking each cell''s validity and marking them as visited. It will find the shortest path through the traversable cells and return the distance.
